# ðŸ’¬ Chatbot template

Saw someone discussing about a mini project for developing a helper chatbot. Dont. You WILL use api calls. You dont have resources to even inference such models. Here goes nothing.

A simple Streamlit app that shows how to build a chatbot using Google's Gemini API.

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
Don't be a soydev.
